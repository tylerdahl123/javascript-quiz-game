# javascript-quiz-game

## Description 

For this assignment i was tasked with creating a web application that uses local storage to save high scores. i also need to utilize the timer function within javascript. this project focused mainly on javascript but allowed me to be able to use everything i have learned so far from HTML to CSS. it was a very challenging assignment and one i didnt actually finish...i was not able to figure out how to decrease the time with the wrong answers. overall it was a challenging yet fun project.

## Installation

all you need is a basic web browers...chrome would be prefered. 


## Usage 

when the user selects start the quiz will run through 3 questions recording their results and keep tracking of score. after the questions array is throug the computer will prompt the user to put in a user name that will then be saved to the high score table.
